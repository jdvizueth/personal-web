        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a computer science student at Cornell University concentrating in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I
          am
          passionate about exploring the frontiers of technology and harnessing its potential to make a
          meaningful impact.
          Some of my interests include Image Processing, Databases, and Full Stack Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working on something, I enjoy my free time building keyboards, playing video games, or hanging
          out with friends.

            <h2 class="project-title" data-title="Image Editor V2 - Background Removal"></h2>
          </a>
          <p>A simple image editor capable of isolating specific items from any image among many other features. I
            created this after using the new iPhone
            feature where users can 'pop' a feature from an image, but I did not like that I was not able to choose
            the image features I wanted, so I made my own application with this specific feature.</p>

          </a>
          <p>Another feature that is part of my Image Editor application. It uses the deepai api to create images based
            on the user's prompt. This combined with the other features given in the application allows for specialized
            image feature selection without the need to process them into multiple applications (takes a little to
            load).</p>

            <h2 class="project-title" data-title="PocketCamls"></h2>
          </a>
          <p>One of my favorite projects so far. This game follows a similar formula of Pok√©mon, where camls fight to
            become the very best. Created using the Ocaml programming language, it has heavy use of test-driven
            development and
            abstract data types.
            Developed alongside 2 other members for my Data structures and Functional Programming class. I focused
            mostly on the backened part of the game, such as the constructing the various data types and the different
            scenes of the game. Also created the animation. All of which were fun to work on. </p>

          </a>
          <p>An app meant to display and reserve the best places to take naps throughout Cornell's campus. While a fun
            project, sadly we had to bring the servers down. Created for Cornell's Hack Challenge by a group of 5. I
            worked on the front-end part design using Swift and implemented the connection between the front-end and
            the back-end</p>
